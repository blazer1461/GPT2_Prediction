# GPT2_Prediction
Given a text, the program will predict how surprised the GPT-2 model is. For example, a paragraph with random text will be produce a higher surprisal value than one that's not mismatched.

To use this code, simply run csv_get_test_stimuli_combined. It will pull data files from "Lena's stim" and output a csv file for each Lena stim and a complete average surprisal csv file.
